COSINE_THRESHOLD

The value below which the cosine between the features of the selected item
    and those of the target template is treated as negative.

Specifically, the match between the features of the selected item and the
    template, cos (item,template), is calculated as:

    match = (cosine - COSINE_THRESHOLD) * COSINE_GAIN, where

    COSINE_GAIN = 1.0/(1.0 - COSINE_THRESHOLD) # so that cosine = 1 --> 1.0

CAUTION: Note that a threshold of 1.0 will result in a division by zero error
