DISTANCE_FALLOFF_RATE

For use only with the nonlinear distance cost function.

The rate at which feature sampling falls off as a function of the
    search item's distance from fixation.

This parameter must be calibrated carefully:

The rate of information accumulation is:

    item.dist_wt = 1.0/(1.0 + scaled_distance), where:

    scaled_distance = self.DISTANCE_FALLOFF_RATE * (item.fix_dist/self.DISPLAY_RADIUS), where

    item.fix_dist is the distance (in pixels) between the item and fixation and
    self.DISPLAY_RADIUS is the radius (in pixels) of the whole visual display

Remember that display size, and therefore distance from fixation, is
    expressed in pixels on the screen, so that the maximum distance
    between fixation and any search item is 2 * the radius of the
    search display.
