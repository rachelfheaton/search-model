INTEGRATOR_GUIDED_PRIORITY

This parameter corresponds to Alejo's hypothesis that similarity
    to the target template giudes attention.

The magnitude of this parameter determines the magnitude of that effect:
    The larger the parameter, the faster the model finds the target.
    (If it's too large, the effect is both creepy and cute.)

Specifically, on each iteration:

    item.priority += item.integrator * INTEGRATOR_GUIDED_PRIORITY
