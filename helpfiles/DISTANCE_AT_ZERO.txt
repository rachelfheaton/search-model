DISTANCE_AT_ZERO

For use only with the linear cost of feature weighting with distance.

This is the distance from fixation at which the feature weighting goes to zero.

Less than this distance, the weight increases linearly to 1.0 at distance 0.0.
Greater than or equal to this distance, the weight is zero.
